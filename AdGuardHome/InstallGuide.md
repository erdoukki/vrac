If your router has DNS problems that cannot be resolved, you will need run the following:

```sh
cd /etc
rm resolv.conf
ln -s ../run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf resolv.conf
```

If a client connects to the MV1000 and cannot obtain an ip address, you need to configure DHCP in the DHCP settings page:
